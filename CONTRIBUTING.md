## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [DesignCat Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior. (Note: A formal Code of Conduct file will be added soon).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/designcat/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue on GitHub. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature, why it's needed, and how it should work.

### Submitting New Resources

We are always looking for new, high-quality UI patterns, gradients, and animations! To submit a new resource, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository** and create a new branch.
2.  **Add your CSS**: For new patterns or animations, add the corresponding CSS to the `app/globals.css` file. Please use a unique and descriptive class name, prefixed with `dc-` (for DesignCat) to avoid conflicts. For example: `.dc-your-pattern-name`.
3.  **Add the resource data**: Open `lib/data.ts` and add a new object to the `resources` array. Follow the existing structure:
    ```typescript
    {
      id: 101, // Choose a unique ID
      name: 'Your Awesome Pattern',
      type: 'pattern', // or 'gradient', 'animation', 'effect'
      category: 'geometric', // or 'decorative', etc.
      css: 'bg-[--pattern-your-awesome-pattern]', // The Tailwind utility class for your pattern
      code: {
        html: `<div class="your-pattern-class"></div>`,
        css: `.your-pattern-class {\n  /* Your CSS rules here */\n}`
      },
      isFavorite: false,
    }
    ```
4.  **Submit a Pull Request** with your changes.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to DesignCat? You can start by looking through `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:
- **Good first issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- **Help wanted** - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issues`.

## Development Setup

Ready to contribute code? Hereâ€™s how to set up DesignCat for local development.

1.  **Fork** the `designcat` repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/designcat.git
    ```
3.  **Navigate** to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd designcat
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies** using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
6.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature`.
2.  Make your changes and commit them with a descriptive message.
3.  Push your branch to your fork on GitHub: `git push origin feature/your-amazing-feature`.
4.  Open a pull request to the `main` branch of the original `designcat` repository.
5.  In your PR description, clearly explain the changes you've made and link to any relevant issues.
6.  We will review your PR, provide feedback, and merge it once it's ready.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move file to..." not "Moves file to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Style

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to maintain a consistent code style. Please run it before committing your changes:

```bash
npm run format
```

Thank you again for your interest in contributing to DesignCat!
