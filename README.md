## üöÄ Built with v0 - Vercel's AI

This project was brought to life using **[v0](https://v0.dev)**, Vercel's generative AI platform for building user interfaces. From the initial prototype to the iterative addition of complex features like live previews, search, and animations, v0 was used to generate and refine the React components and Tailwind CSS styles. This approach allowed for rapid development and a focus on creating a high-quality user experience.

- **Zero Dependencies**: The core patterns are pure CSS, ensuring they are lightweight and easy to integrate.
- **Categorized Library**: Easily browse patterns organized into categories like Gradients, Geometric, Animations, and more.
- **Favorites**: Save your most-used patterns to your personal collection using local storage.
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find the perfect pattern with a powerful search and category filters.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The grid animates smoothly when filtering and searching, powered by Framer Motion.
